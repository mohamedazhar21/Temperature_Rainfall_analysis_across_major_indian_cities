# Rainfall & Temperature Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of historical rainfall and temperature data across major Indian cities. The primary focus is on data preprocessing, cleaning, and exploratory SQL analysis to uncover weather patterns and trends.

The dataset consists of daily weather metrics such as maximum and minimum temperatures, and rainfall (in mm). The data was sourced from individual city-level tables, cleaned to handle nulls, blanks, and inconsistent formats, and then merged into a unified dataset for cross-city analysis.

## Folder Structure

`sql_queries/`: Contains all SQL scripts used for data cleaning, temperature analysis, rainfall trends, and other exploratory insights.
- `README.md`: Project overview, objectives, and instructions to understand and replicate the analysis.

## Key Insights

- Heatwave detection using temperature trends
- Longest dry/wet streaks per city
- Yearly and monthly rainfall statistics
- Temperature deviation across cities

## Tools Used

- PostgreSQL for querying and data processing  
- Microsoft Excel -  for initial exploration and formatting
